function y = my_encoder(x, mapping)
%MY_ENCODER Maps a vector of M-ary integers to constellation points
%   Y = MY_ENCODER(X, MAPPING) outputs a vector of (possibly complex)
%   symbols from the constellation specified as second parameter,
%   corresponding to the integer valued symbols of X.  Input X can be
%   a row or column vector, and output Y has the same dimensions as X.
%   If the length of vector MAPPING is M, then the message symbols of
%   X must be integers between 0 and M-1.

% Indexing outputs the same dimension as the INDEXED object, no matter the
% dimension of the indexing object (Well, for arbitrary indexing MxN matrices - not row or column - it outputs the same dimension as the matrix)
% So if the indexed object (mapping) does not have the same dimension as
% the indexing object, we transpose it

mapping = mapping(:); % we make it column
if (size(x, 1) == 1) % input is row vector
    mapping = transpose(mapping); % we make the mapping a row as well so the output is a row vector
end

% We can use the vector x directly to index vector mapping, we
% just need to add 1 to x since indices start at 1 and not at 0.
